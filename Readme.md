## Overview

Greenwich allows users to translate your Cocoa applications quickly and conveniently using a
simple interface that is packaged directly within the application:

As a translator works through the strings in your application, she can simply relaunch the
application at any time to see the changes directly in the app. This significantly improves
the feedback loop for translators and will result in better, faster translations.

Greenwich has been built both for translators and for developers. As a developer, you'll no
longer have to think about localization again. Greenwich has scripts that integrate directly
into your build process &mdash; strings will be extracted from both your xib files and your
source code as you go. Set it up once, and forget about it. Your strings files will always be
kept up to date, and Greenwich will do most of the heavy lifting for you. Enough talk, let's
get this thing set up already!
